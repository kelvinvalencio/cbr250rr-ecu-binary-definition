# CBR250RR Stock ECU Binary Definition & XDF

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è About
I find it difficult to flash my bike's ECU because the definition file is not available for free. The ones sold on the Internet cost a lot and are not really complete. So I decided to analyze the binary myself and publish the known definition, which address does what.  
<br>**This information wasn't publicly available on th Internet at the time of my first publication**, so my hope is that this project will be able to help individual/user/amateur tuners tune their own bike.
The goal of this project is to make public this definition and improve them(mappings and their categorization).

Your help is one of the most important aspect of this project, there are a lot of maps that could be grouped to certain Gear, Riding Modes, etc.

# How to Help Improve
1. Go to the [repository page](https://github.com/kelvinvalencio/cbr250rr-ecu-binary-definition)
2. Test the free-to-downlaod XDF that I released **OR** read the definition tables in the repository page
3. If you find something, go to the **discussions** tab and click on **new discussion** or report to me
4. I will revise the XDF and the definition tables

# Scope
Supported ECU Model is **38770-K64-N04**. Original bin checksum value: **C2FF** 

# üìÑüìë Binary Definition & XDF Release
I have released a usable XDF for 38770-K64-N04 and is free to download. I also published the whole binary definition that includes fuel map, ignition map, limiters, and more.
