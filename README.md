# ‚ÑπÔ∏è About CBR250RR ECU Binary Definition
This is my personal project, the goal is to analyze, publish, and improve CBR250RR stock ECU binary definition. <br>**This information wasn't publicly available on the Internet at the time of my first publication**, so my hope is that this project will be able to help individual/user/amateur tuners tune their own bike.  
Supported ECU Model is **38770-K64-N04**. Original bin checksum value: **C2FF** 

### Community Help & Support
I need your help to improve and categorize these maps! Discussions are encouraged here!
You can help improving this definition by clicking **new issue** in **issues** tab OR **email me at** <kelvinvalencio@protonmail.com>  
Your contributions will help me and others build a better definition. **I will credit your work** in the credits section.

### Warning
- I'm not responsible for any damage/consequences that occurs. This documentation is aimed to be a guide for individual/user/amateur tuners.
- Some if not all information published here might not be accurate or straight up incorrect, anything that you do with this information is entirely your responsibility, with that in mind, I very much accept corrections. If you find any inaccurate information, I will make sure to revise them.

### Breakpoints
Value breakpoints, could be called axis data
- MAP units are still unknown, it could be actual pressure or just senso voltage, **contact me if you know**
- TPS highest value is 661, divided by 100 (percent) as 100% throttle input
- Cell data size 2 Bytes (16 bit)
- TBW breakpoint might not be accurate, I found it directly above TBW maps, highest value is 802

| Start Address | Description | Table Size | Conversion/Factor Offset
| -- | -- | -- | --
| 0x41222 | Manifold Air Pressure breakpoint | 25x1 | (not converted)
| 0x41254 | RPM breakpoint | 35x1 | (not converted)
| 0x411F0 | Throttle Position Sensor breakpoint | 25x1 | X/6.61
| 0x50CF6 | Throttle-By-Wire breakpoint | 29x1 | Unknown, please contact me if you know

### Fuel Map
Most likely injection duration in microseconds during intake stroke.
- Identical maps are considered Cylinder 1 & Cylinder 2 pair
- They haven't been grouped/categorized yet
- Unit for the values are unknown, **if you know please contact me**
- Table size 25x35. Cell data size 2 Bytes (16 bit)

### Start Of Injection
This map should specify injector timing/when to inject fuel in degrees before Top Dead Center during intake stroke.
- Table size is unknown, **if you know please contact me**
- Cell data size 1 Byte (8 bit)

### Ignition Map
Ignition-related map. Most likely degrees before Top Dead Center to ignite spark plug during compression stroke.
- Identical maps are considered Cylinder 1 & Cylinder 2 pair
- They haven't been grouped/categorized yet, **if you discover a pattern please contact me**
- These maps could either be categorized by **gear** and **riding mode**, but not tested yet
- I haven't found the correct conversion/factor offset, **if you know how to translate the numbers please contact me**
- Table size 25x35. Cell data size 2 Bytes (16 bit)

### Limiters
Thailand version of CBR250RR has RPM limiter of 15000. Their stock ECU's binary is compared to find useful limiter values

- These are not limiters by gear, still uncategorized, please let me know if you can group them
- Cell data size 2 Bytes (16 bit)

| Start Address | Columns | Description | Conversion/Factor Offset
| -- | -- | -- | --

### Throttle-By-Wire Map
This should specify actual throttle body opening (Throttle Input vs RPM vs Throttle Opening), though not confirmed yet. **Please test and send back the result to me**
- ‚ö†Ô∏èThere are 2 maps I don't know which riding mode they belong (TBW #1 & TBW #2), **contact me if you know!**
- This map might be categorized by gear, though not tested yet
- Factor offset is based on the highest value in these maps, which is **13238** divided by 100 (percent) as 100% throttle opening, **contact me if it's incorrect**
- Table size 29x35. Cell data size 2 Bytes (16 bit)
