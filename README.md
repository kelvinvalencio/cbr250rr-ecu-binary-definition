# ‚ÑπÔ∏è About CBR250RR ECU Binary Definition
This is my personal project, the goal is to analyze, publish, and improve CBR250RR stock ECU binary definition. <br>**This information wasn't publicly available on the Internet at the time of my first publication**, so my hope is that this project will be able to help individual/user/amateur tuners tune their own bike.  
Supported ECU Model is **38770-K64-N04**. Original bin checksum value: **C2FF** 

### Community Help & Support
I need your help to improve and categorize these maps! Discussions are encouraged here!
You can help improving this definition by clicking **New Discussion** in **Discussions** tab OR **email me at** <kelvinvalencio@protonmail.com>  
Your contributions will help me and others build a better definition. **I will credit your work** in the credits section.

### Warning
- I'm not responsible for any damage/consequences that occurs. This documentation is aimed to be a guide for individual/user/amateur tuners.
- Some if not all information published here might not be accurate or straight up incorrect, anything that you do with this information is entirely your responsibility, with that in mind, I very much accept corrections. If you find any inaccurate information, I will make sure to revise them.

### Axis Tables
Value breakpoints, could be called axis data
- MAP units are still unknown, it could be actual pressure or just senso voltage, **contact me if you know**
- TPS highest value is 661, divided by 100 (percent) as 100% throttle input
- Cell data size 2 Bytes (16 bit)
- TBW axis might not be accurate, I found it directly above TBW maps, highest value is 802

| Start Address | Description | Columns | Conversion/Factor Offset
| -- | -- | -- | --
| 0x41222 | Manifold Air Pressure axis | 25 | (not converted)
